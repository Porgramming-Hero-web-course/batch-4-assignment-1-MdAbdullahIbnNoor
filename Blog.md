# Understanding the Power of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript
TypeScript's powerful type system helps developers write safer, more maintainable code. Among its standout features are **union** and **intersection types**â€”two concepts that add significant flexibility and precision to your code. In this post, we'll explore the significance of these types and how to use them effectively to improve your TypeScript projects.

## What are Union Types?

A **union type** allows a variable to hold one of several specified types. Union types give us the flexibility to say, "this value could be of type A or type B," making it perfect for cases where multiple types are valid for a single value.

### Syntax
To create a union type, use the pipe symbol (`|`) between the types:

```typescript
let value: string | number;
value = "Hello";  // Valid
value = 42;       // Also valid

### In this case, userId can either be a string or a number. This is useful when you have multiple functions with different parameter types but similar functionality.
